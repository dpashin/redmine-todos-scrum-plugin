= nested todo/scrum-ish plugin for redmine

This is a fork for Redmine 2.2.0

You can get the original from https://github.com/dalyons/redmine-todos-scrum-plugin

= Description
A nested, easy to use project based todos plugin for Redmine. Allows easy creation and management of infinitely nestable todo lists on a per project basis, that can be organised into sprints(or releases).
Also provides global 'My Todos' for all projects. Todos can be allocated to uses, and tied to Redmine Issues.

Currently has translations for Russian, Chinese, Spanish, Italian, French, German, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Brazilian Portugese and English, thanks to contributions from others.

Thanks to dalyons for his original work

= Requirements
* Redmine 2.2.0

= Installation
* Follow the Redmine plugin installation steps at: http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins
* Cd to your redmine plugins/ dir
* Git-clone the plugin from this repo into a folder in there (git clone git://github.com/hshield/redmine-todos-scrum-plugin.git redmine_todos_plugin)
* Run +bundle install+ to install the required gems
* Run the plugin migrations +rake redmine:plugins:migrate+
* Restart your Redmine web servers (e.g. mongrel, thin, mod_rails)
* Login to your Redmine install as an Administrator
* Setup the permissions for the todos module for your roles
* Enable the module on a per-project basis as needed.

NOTE: the plugin directory *has* to be "redmine_todos_plugin", because Engines loads plugin stylesheets by path, not plugin name, which is a little lame.
